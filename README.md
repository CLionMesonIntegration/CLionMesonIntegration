# CLion Meson Integration
This plugin attempts to add CMake-like integration for the Meson Build
System in CLion.

This plugin is very early in development, and is not anywhere close to
production ready. You can check the progress
[here](https://github.com/NonNullDinu/CLionMesonIntegration/projects/1).
